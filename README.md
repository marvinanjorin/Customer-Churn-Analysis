# Customer-Churn-Analysis
A beginner-friendly churn analysis project using Excel. It explores customer behavior, churn patterns by state, usage metrics, and service calls. Includes step-by-step insights, pivot tables, and visualizations‚Äîall structured to be easy to follow and useful for real-world applications.
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Welcome to my first major data analysis project! This project investigates customer churn in a telecom company using Excel. The goal is to understand why customers leave, what behaviors signal churn, and how companies can proactively reduce it.

I was intentional about clarity and simplicity ‚Äî making insights easy to understand and actionable for both data professionals and non-technical stakeholders.

INTRODUCTION

Customer churn is one of the most critical KPIs in the telecom industry. In this project, I use Excel to explore customer usage patterns, complaints, and engagement data to identify churn risks and suggest retention strategies.




SCREEN 1: https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%201.png?raw=true

Calculate the Churn Rate 
Basic churn rate formula: Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Who Churned / Total Customers) * 100
This helped establish a benchmark for how serious the churn issue is.



SCREEN 2: Descriptive Statistics and Churn Patterns https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%202.png?raw=true

Used summary statistics (mean, min, max, standard deviation) on:
Total Day Minutes
Total Day Calls
Customer Service Calls
Compared churned vs non-churned customers to identify behavioral differences.



SCREEN 3: Exploring Data by State and Churn Grouped churn data by U.S. states. https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%203.png?raw=true

Identified top 5 states with highest churn rates:
New Jersey, California, Washington, Maryland, Montana
These became the focus for deeper behavioral insights.


SCREEN 4: Exploring Data by Voice Mail Plan and Churn  https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%204.png?raw=true

Analyzed whether having a voice mail plan affects churn.
Found that customers without a voicemail plan were more likely to churn ‚Äî indicating possible unmet needs or lack of engagement.



SCREEN 5: Analyzing Frequency Distributions  https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%205.png?raw=true

Looked at how often churned customers contacted customer service.
High frequency often correlated with churn ‚Äî suggesting poor experience or unresolved issues.



SCREEN 6: Visualizing Data by State and Churn https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%206.png?raw=true

Created bar charts and pivot tables to:

I. Compare usage metrics by state

II. Highlight churn hotspots
Visuals made it easier to detect churn trends tied to location and usage.





SCREEN 7: Exploring and Visualizing Data by Churn https://github.com/marvinanjorin/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/Screen%207.png?raw=true

Focused on key metrics:

voice_mail_plan

number_vmail_messages

total_day_minutes

total_day_calls

total_day_charge

customer_service_calls

Built pivot charts to compare average behavior of churned vs non-churned customers.

Helped uncover:
High-usage churners
Frequent complainers
Plan-related churn patterns

Conclusion & Recommendations

Summary of Insights:
High day-time usage and customer service complaints are strong churn signals.
States with high churn often had higher customer engagement but unresolved issues.
Voice mail plan adoption was lower among churners, hinting at product fit issues.



Recommendations:

Prioritize retention in high-churn states through targeted outreach.
Improve first-contact resolution in customer service to reduce repeat complaints.
Offer value-added services (like voicemail) more visibly to high-usage customers.
Use churn prediction models to proactively flag at-risk users based on behavior.
